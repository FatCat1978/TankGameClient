## Network Tank Game

You know what this is.

## How do I download it?
if you don't have a github, make one. you shouldn't be able to see this if you don't. after that, make a **FORK** . go to your fork's page, and **CLONE** the fork using github desktop.  clone. the. fork. do. not. clone. this. at. all.

## How do I CONTRIBUTE???

on your **CLONED FORK**, make a new branch. Make any changes you want on THE BRANCH. once you do that, PUSH your changes online, then make a PULL REQUEST with the branch you just made the change on.

BRANCHES don't need to be single line. at all. don't assume they should be single line changes. they're for entire features, or large changes. make the pull request when you start working on something else, OR someone else needs the code for something.

When in doubt, ask Connor.

Seriously. please.
